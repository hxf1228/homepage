abstract: Diagnosis of mechanical faults in manufacturing systems is critical
  for ensuring safety and saving costs. With the development of data
  transmission and sensor technologies, measuring systems can acquire massive
  amounts of multi-sensor data. Although Deep-Learning (DL) provides an
  end-to-end way to address the drawbacks of traditional methods, it is
  necessary to do deep research on an intelligent fault diagnosis method based
  on Multi-Sensor Data. In this project, a novel intelligent diagnosis method
  based on Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is
  explored. Firstly, a Multi-Signals-to-RGB-Image conversion method based on
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to fuse multi-signal data into
  three-channel RGB images. Then, an improved CNN with residual networks is
  proposed, which can balance the relationship between computational cost and
  accuracy. Two datasets are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
  method. The results show the proposed method outperforms other DL-based
  methods in terms of accuracy.
