abstract: Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery is essential for maintaining
  system performance and ensuring the operation safety. Deep learning (DL) has
  been recently developed rapidly and achieved remarkable results in fault
  diagnosis. However, the temporal information from time-series signals is
  ignored by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based methods. Besides, the
  robustness against the noise is essential to methods for fault diagnosis.
  Therefore, a novel method based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is
  proposed to identify fault types in rotating machinery in this paper.
  One-dimensional time-series vibration signals are first converted into
  two-dimensional images. Then, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is introduced to
  exploit temporal information of time-series data and learn representative
  features from constructed images. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is finally
  employed to implement fault recognition. Experimental results show that the
  proposed method achieves the best performance on two public datasets compared
  with existing work and exhibits the robustness against the noise.
