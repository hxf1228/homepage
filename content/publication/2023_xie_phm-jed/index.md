abstract: "Multisensory systems play a critical role in prognostics and health management (PHM), and utilise the information from multi-device synchronous measurements for fault diagnosis and predictive maintenance. But it is not suitable for specific systems with limited bandwidth and energy reservoirs since the increased sophistication of measurement devices requires more computation and power resources. This research explores a data-driven analytical framework for multisensory system analysis and design in PHM. The proposed framework provides the optimal subset of reliable sensors to make trade-offs between accuracy demands and system constraints. The integration definition for function modelling method is adopted for modelling and functional analysis of the proposed framework. An adaptive signal conversion algorithm is designed to process the data from all reliable sensors in the system. The convolutional neural network with residual learning is built for automatic feature extraction. Combined with the evaluation rules and expert knowledge, performance analyses are obtained, including qualitative results, fault diagnosis, and the optimal sensor combination. An open-source bearing dataset of the multisensory system with five measurements is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework."
